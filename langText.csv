My name is Ezio Auditore da Firenze ...,13184
"It has been fifteen years since the Spaniard, Rodrigo Borgia, murdered my family and drove me into exile...  Since that time I have suffered greatly but learned a great deal more... I am an Assassin ... ... as my father and grandfathers were before me",13403
"Compelled by duty to my order, I have set aside my search for the Spaniard to recover an ancient artifact recently stolen from us",13514
My thirst for vengeance is strong ...,13547
"... but my responsibility to the Assassins is stronger still.Antonio's been asking for you, EzioÇ. You should talk to him.Ezio! I have been singing your praises to this gentleman. He has a proposition for you.I represent a man who has come to Venezia on a foolish errand. I fear his life is in danger, but he refuses to listen to my counsel.",13841
"And you want me to protect him?It would ease my mind. Antonio claims you are the deadliest man in Italia.That's true. But I am not a hired blade.Ezio, let the man round out his request.... ",14005
"The gentleman I represent has organized a meeting with someone called The SpaniardÇ.You see, Ezio... the Spaniard has come to us!All right. I will protect your friend, but not his business.If that is what it takes to keep Christoffa from harm, so be it.What is the meaning of this delay? The Spaniard promised me an hour of his time.Apologies, Master Christoffa, but the Spaniard's plans have changed. All he requires is proof of your death.Ah! Fortune favors me. Unless you mean me harm as well.A friend of yours sent me to guard you",14470
"Luis Santangel... he cautioned me against this meeting, but I wouldn't listen.How did you find the Spaniard? He isn't one to make many public appearances.",14606
"It was he who found me, actually. He caught wind of my planned expedition West, and expressed a desire to fund it.This meeting was to be our first of many. But as you can see, it went rather askew",14776
Run! I will draw them away.That shook them. I should be safe. As for Christoffa's safety... perhaps I should check back with Antonio,14896
The meeting was a trap.Hm... Santangel's intuition proved correct.It seems so. Where is he,14977
"He asked that you meet him in the Gardens District, should anything go wrong.I'll go, but with caution. ",15068
"Antonio, who are these two men?",15095
"I don't know. Santangel contacted the thieves' guild from Espa°a. When we met, he explained his plight and that's when I contacted you.I'm flattered, but let's not turn this into a habit.Ezio, thank you for all you have done.I'm glad to see you safe, Christoffa, but I am not here to further your interests. I have questions of my own. I won't have many answers. Borgia was merely a financial opportunity. I didn't know him personally",15476
"But you may have another chance to find him. Tell him, Christoffa....",15538
"The Spaniard discovered our lodgings. Our hostel is crawling with his soldiers.They are searching for an atlas of significant worth, containing maps charting a Western route to the Orient.We are prepared to leave Italia for good, but not without that Atlas. In the wrong hands, it could cause great harm.Va bene. But this will be my final favor.Thank you, Ezio. We will wait for your return in the harbor district.The atlas... no mistaking that for anything else.",15938
"Ah, there he is! Do you have the Atlas! Show it! ",15981
"Take it and go. Borgia's soldiers are combing the streets.A few maps are missingÇ but the Piri Reis map remains. We are satisfied.  Gentlemen, if you return to Italia in the future, bring your own protection",16161
"We would have done so, but there are no more men in  Espa°a of your skill. Not since a group of Assassins were imprisoned by Tomas Torquemada's inquisitors.",16297
Wait! What do you know of the Assassins?,16333
"I am a well connected man, Ezio, with a great number of friends. Sadly, the Inquisition has made a recent habit of arresting them.Luis, our ship is waiting!Be well, Ezio. May you find everything you seek.Distressing news, Antonio. My search for the Apple of Eden will have to be postponed. I'm going to Barcelona.",16609
I'd heard rumors of some turmoil there. What's wrong,16656
Santangel claims that a number of Assassins there have been jailed. I feel it is my duty to help them...A noble cause. I will put you in contact with my people there. They should be of some help.Antonio gave me the names of two contacts. One of them should be able to provide me with information.,16910
"Yes, there's a thieves' guild nearby. Somewhere in the center of town.Find the tallest building in town. There's a secret door on the roof.",17030
"Empty, as I feared. Now my only recourse is with the inquisitors themselves.Halt! These premises are the property of the church!How strange to meet a gentleman leaping through these sewers. Are you on the run, or just recreating?Step aside, stranger.You bear the mark of the Assassins ... and from the cut of your outfit I'd say you were ... Venetian?No, Florentine. What do you know of the Assassins?Only that I am one of them, sir. My name is Raphael Sanchez. I arrived here this morning, bound to the same errand as you",17483
Do you know who betrayed us to the Inquisitors?,17525
"Not yet, but we know the name of the Inquisitor Prosecutor responsible for their arrests. Gaspar Martinez.I'd like to meet this Prosecutor.Good. Find me again when you're finished with him.",17691
"I hope we can speak without interruption, Gaspar. Who gave you the names of the imprisoned Assassins?",17779
"What do you mean ""Assassins""? Our dungeons are for heretics, not medieval phantoms.",17852
"No... your purge was too systematic to be a coincidence.Whoever those men claim to be, it won't matter after today.A public burning is about to commence for one of them. A willful young man.If he dies, I will keep that fire burning until this town is a cinder.",18078
What's this? A list?,18097
"Six names... they may be Assassins too... when Sanchez and I cross paths again, I will ask him.",18182
"Steady now. Are you all right?I will be once I leave this place.There he is! Our man of action. Thank you for your help. We cut it close, Raphael. And may yet have more work. Look here. I found a troubling list.I know these men. But they are not local. They live in Zaragoza, in the kingdom of Aragon.The Inquisitor carried this.Then it is safe to assume these men are also targets.Zaragoza will be my next stop. Will you come?",18555
"I will. Although my skills as a fighter are dwindling, I know the town well and could serve as your guide.",18648
"Stay safe gentlemen.Seek out the Inquisition's Calificador, Pedro Llorente. His tribunal meets in a building on the far side of town.",18765
You're not coming,18782
"Oh, no. I'm too well known here. If a tragedy should befall Pedro, I'll need an alibi.",18859
Tomas Torquemada! An unexpected but welcome visit,18905
"I require neither your blessing nor your permission to enter here, Pedro. How is our prisoner? ",18987
"A staunch one. He refuses to convert or confess. Most who are brought here feel they have God's protection, no matter what their faith... and yet they always tremble with fright.But you.... You dismiss the idea of God altogether, and yet you show no fear.Remarkable... Rodrigo Borgia was right to have me arrest you and your cohorts... your lack of faith is a disease.Let the heretic bleed.Already dead... so it was The Spaniard himself who had these men arrested and branded heretics.",19405
I won't allow the remaining five to share this man's fate.,19455
"Many thanks, brother.",19475
You have my thanks.,19493
"What in God's name is going on here! Four escaped heretics?We did not anticipate such an organized resistance, Your Holiness.You assumed the people of Zaragoza would shrug off the random imprisonment of six eminent men?",19683
"We accused them of countless heresies, Pedro. Publicly!",19733
"Your duties do not end with their imprisonment! They begin there!Whoever freed those four men will certainly be looking for the last. Guard our prisoner at all costs, or Torquemada will personally supervise your disemboweling.My most heartfelt thanks, stranger",19960
"Nothing strange about me, friend. We're one and the same.Ezio, the shadows of my city are moving again! How many of our brothers were you able to find?Five of six. An inquisitor named Torquemada murdered one before I could reach him.",20164
"That would be Tomas Torquemada, the King's Grand Inquisitor... he must be here to speak with Pedro Llorente",20260
I saw them together. It appears their orders to arrest the assassins came directly from Rodrigo Borgia himself.Just as we suspected: contact between the Templars and the Inquisitors.Both these men must be stopped. Pedro will be easy to find here in Zaragoza.,20482
But locating Torquemada may take some time,20520
"I'm a patient man, Sanchez.What's this? You're not allowed in here!Excuse my intrusion, but I was told you might know how to get me in contact with the Templars.",20662
"The Templars? Surely you're joking, young man. The Templars were disgraced and disbanded two centuries ago. Rumors of their continued activities are as reliable as fairy tales.",20816
"That's a shame, Padre... if they don't exist, they won't be able to save you.Pedro is dead, but I have neither seen nor heard any sign of Torquemada.I guessed you wouldn't. It's a pity the Queen failed to mention to me that her dear Grand Inquisitor was in town",21043
You have spoken with Queen Isabella,21076
"I work for her, Ezio. As her treasurer. While you were out freeing our brothers, I was attending a finance meeting.",21176
An Assassin embedded in the monarchy's highest ranks... fascinating.,21237
"We have one of her ears, and it may be that the Templars have the other.Naturally, Isabella and King Ferdinand are ignorant of our infiltration.Come, I will tell you more on the road to Granada.",21403
"I have freed those I came to rescue. I should be returning to Italia.Ezio, I beg you to stay and help me. We are on the fringe of a grand Templar scheme. ComeÇ I will explain.",21555
"...and so, spurred  by their desire to see the kingdom of Espa°a united by a single faith, the Inquisitors convinced the Queen and King to drive out the remaining Moors.",21701
"This is why war rages here in Granada. The palace of Alhambra and the city surrounding it are the last Moorish strongholds on the continent.It sounds like the battle is already won.One would think... but for some reason the Moors continue to fight. Perhaps King Muhammad XII has a death wish.Hold..., we have reached the outskirts of the city. It is a disputed territory and still quite dangerous. What is our course?We'll do a sweep of the area, and eliminate all threats. We must make it safe for the civilians to move about.",22152
"We have quelled the worst violence, but pockets of resistance remain.Bands of lawless soldiers are harassing civilians. We cannot let this city descend into anarchy",22294
"When you are certain the civilians are safe, meet me in the chapel at the center of the village.",22374
"Soldiers kidnapped my wife and child. Follow me, sir! Quickly!",22432
"Luis Santangel? This is an unusual coincidence.Not a coincidence at all, Ezio. Sanchez sent word that you might be joining us. We Assassins run in close circles, after all.The world is not so large as it feels, is it",22620
"Wherever you go, you are bound to find one of us working in secret... in the court of a monarch, for instance.",22715
Both of you work for Isabella and Ferdinand?,22755
It has taken many years and reluctant conversions to gain their confidence. But it has been necessary. The King and Queen are easily swayed by pious blather.,22890
"There will be time later to explain our purpose in greater detail, but we have need of your skills now.A Templar Spy is passing false information to King Muhammad inside the city, encouraging him to continue the fight. Find the secret passage the spy is using before killing him.If this war does not end swiftly, the Templars will continue to use the chaos to their advantage.You there. Open the gate to the catacombs",23248
"Off to counsel King Muhammad, are you? I don't understand that fool. Why does he keep us fighting this pointless war?",23351
Are you being insubordinate Soldier? Just open the damn gates!,23406
"Yes, sir.Ha ha. The poor lad's got no idea does he",23451
"And it had better stay that way. If anyone knew we were prolonging this war deliberately, it would alter the Queen's tactics.By God, you Templars convolute even the simplest plans.Our Assassin returns... did you find the Spy?I did... I overheard him talking about keeping Espa°a embroiled in this war deliberately.Interesting... first they seek Christoffa's map, then they come to Espa°a to exacerbate a war that does not concern them.",23831
We have suspected for some time that the Templars were planning their own expedition west. This may be their way of delaying Christoffa's journey.,23958
"That atlas must contain wonders to inspire such broad schemes.Indeed. But we will not know how true they are until Christoffa has set sail. And that won't happen until this war is over.I fear something terrible has happened to King Muhammad. He was once an ally to the Assassins... but we have not heard from him in many months.Find him if you can, if the Templars haven't already.I'll enter through the catacombs. The Templar Spy preferred that route.Explosions from above... has the siege started again?",24394
The city is under siege and everything is locked down ... this won't be easy.  ,24463
"I must apologize, Boabdil, for putting your beautiful city through such hardship.I am King Muhammad of Nasrid, usurper. Untie me!I will regret the destruction of Alhambra palace. Unfortunately, the Spanish siege must continue until Granada is dust, and the Queen is penniless.My dislike of Isabella pales in comparison to the hatred I feel for you and your Templar stooges.",24790
"Hold on to that anger. It may comfort you in your final hours.Peace be upon you, sir. For whom do you work",24884
"Luis Santangel sent me to find you. He assumed you were dead, or had gone mad.I am happy to admit to neither. The Assassins and I haven't always seen eye to eye, but I have been grateful for their aid over the years.We need to end this war. As much as it may pain you, your time in Espa°a is at its end.Too many missteps and misunderstandings to repair... yes, I agree. What shall we do?",25216
"I will cross the city and open the gates, carrying word of your abdication. Stay here until the city has fallen silent.War is ended, and a conciliatory King Muhammad is in a meeting with the Queen to discuss terms.Oh, I have been waiting for this moment, Luis! Do you feel it, the tide shifting beneath us?",25479
"Patience, Christoffa. It will take some time for Isabella to entertain thoughts of spending money on you.I have been waiting SIX YEARS for an answer from the Queen. If she cannot indulge me now, I will indulge other offers!",25674
"Christoffa, don't be foolish. We're close!",25713
"We've been close for too long, Luis. It's now or never.Damn him. It's too soon to go begging for money from a war weary monarch.Help! We need soldiers! Mobs are trying to burn the city down! ",25881
"Ezio, this is more Templar meddling.",25914
"Wars never end abruptly, do they?They never end at all, Sanchez. It just appears that way when the body count is low.You have given us an advantage. And when we secure a mandate for Christoffa's voyage, you will have given us hope as well.My understanding is still cloudy. Hope for what exactly?Most men stoke their imagination of what lies beyond the ocean sea with stories of quick routes to Cipango and Cathay..",26275
"But Christoffa's maps tell another tale, one the Templars know quite well... legends of an intermediate land as large as our own.Another continent?A new world, Ezio...",26421
"How are you holding up, Luis?My patience is thin. Torquemada has already dispatched an Inquisitor to round up heretics for trial in Granada.",26544
Torquemada should be arrested for the abuses! Surely the Queen would side with you if the truth were exposed.,26639
"No, she would never believe such charges. Torquemada has been Isabella's confessor since she was a young woman.Besides, it would be unwise to allow such turmoil to disrupt our plans for Christoffa",26811
"Hold fast, gentlemen. I will try to calm this chaos.Inquisitor soldiers are out in full force, meting out blind punishments for invisible offences.Ezio, find the Inquisitor in charge of this operation.",26987
"Eliminate him when he is alone, in secret, otherwise the violence will redouble and we will lose our advantage.The Queen let the Moor King live? Isabella's heart is not hard enough to do lasting good for Espa°a. When the time is right, I will give her counsel. Espa°a must be unified. One people, one faith.Until then, Tomas...?Round up all who do not profess allegiance to the Pope and expel them. If they resist, you are free to do as you will.Yes Tomas. God be with you.And you, Juan de Marillo. May he guide your every step.",27445
"Round up your best men and prepare for a sweep of the city.I must not be seen anywhere near this man's body... patience.Santangel, who is our guest?I am Ezio Auditore, a Florentine by birth, and a wayfarer by trade.",27634
"He is a friend, Queen Isabella. It was Ezio who brokered King Muhammad's surrender.Ezio Auditore ... it seems the whole of Espa°a owes you a great debt. ",27770
I wonder if Christoffa Corombo might profit a little from my royal largess.,27836
"I wish I could vivify his withering dream, but our funds are still scarce. Take comfort knowing that the King of France has made him a recent offer.",27965
He cannot be serious!,27984
"Well he certainly thought it was genuine. He left for Paris this morning. Oh, that fool! Ezio... he is still in great danger",28092
"I will find him.Bring him back here. And tell him ... tell him the Queen has had a change of heart.Christoffa, halt! You're in great danger",28215
"Do not interfere, Ezio! I've had quite enough counseling from your quarter!Help!Has the world gone so mad that a simple adventurer cannot go but a few weeks without being attacked in the street!Christoffa, you are no simple adventurer. Unfortunately only you and the King of France recognize this.",28475
"King Charles hasn't the mettle to back you... this is a Templar trick.Have you any proof of your outrageous claim?I don't need any. Santangel has assured me that Isabella has had a change of heart.Good God, how I loath these games! Lead the way, EzioÇA fascinating proposal, Luis. And one I would gladly accept were Christoffa to return.And return he has! What's the good news?Inspiring words and a few bags of coin have changed the Queen's mind. Prepare to set sail, Christoffa.How many bags of coin did it require?Your friends have agreed to cover half of the total costs, Christoffa.Praise you Luis, you fine and gracious man.",29025
"Soon we will be praising you, my friend. For all the wonders you will find and report to the world.",29111
But let all rejoicing wait until we have seen your crosstrees dip below the horizon.,29183
"Yes, Santangel. Caution! Yours has saved me from myself more times than I should admit.Come gentlemen. Let us celebrate!I just received word ... Christoffa has set sail from Palos with three ships and his precious atlas. I am honored to have helped you all, and wish I could be here to welcome him home, but conflicts of my own now draw me back to Italia.Of course. The search for your stolen artifact continues.",29540
"Luis! You must hide! Torquemada has dispatched guards to arrest you.Contemptible man! He already forced a conversion from me... now I suspect the Templars are feeding him orders.Revenge for spoiling their war, I suppose. Stay here, Luis. I'll handle this.This was no arrest. They intended to murder me!",29806
I'm certain they will be after Sanchez in due course.,29853
"I won't let that happen.Once Sanchez is safe, find Torquemada and bring him to justice.",29931
Is that wise? You said yourself that Torquemada was off limits.,29987
Just use your best judgement... and let no one see you,30035
"Ah... you have a knack for timing. One minute more and I'd have been dead, or worse....",30113
We riled up the Templars and now they're openly sending Inquisitors to imprison us.,30186
"Revenge by proxy. It's time to find Torquemada and end this.Before you do anything rash, make him talk. Find out how close to the Templars he really is.You are a vile and pitiful man, Torquemada. And your alliance with the Spaniard has disqualified you from your God's love.",30427
"You dare to lecture me? I am the hammer of heretics, the light of Espa°a, the honor of my order. I follow none but God's command.All lies. Rodrigo Borgia is an unbeliever like me, and yet you lavish him with favors.",30614
"A fantastic tale, and a spurious one. Borgia is one of three Papal candidates this year. And he is as devoted to God as I am.There's no better hiding place than in the shadow of virtue. You are as blind to his evil as you are to yours",30812
"So what will you do with me, heathen? Murder me? Slit my throat and bathe in my blood?",30887
"NoÇ I prefer a quick, clean kill.Guards!",30926
"You will discover the truth about Rodrigo Borgia in time. But by then it will be too late.Forgive me, my friends. Torquemada escaped",31043
"But not before enlightening me on one or two points. He is a petty man, consumed by self-deception.What of his connection to the Spaniard?",31162
"He admires Rodrigo Borgia, but I do not believe Torquemada is a Templar himself. Merely a credulous old sycophant.",31263
Perhaps this is for the best. Torquemada's death would have caused more turmoil than it ended.,31344
"We will work hard to distance him from the Queen, while we protect ourselves from his inquisitors.",31429
"Best of luck, my new friends. And send me word when Christoffa returns.He has promised to write me the moment he arrives. I will forward a copy of any letter he sends.I look forward to it...Ono (Ezio attack emote.)Ono (Ezio attack emote.)Ono (Ezio attack emote.)Ono (Ezio attack emote.)Ono (Ezio attack emote.)Ono (Ezio dies)Ono (Ezio dies)Ono (Ezio dies)Ono (Effort while climbing)Ono (Effort while climbing)Ono (Effort while climbing)Ono (Effort while climbing)Ono (Effort while climbing)Ono (Effort noise while jumping)Ono (Effort noise while jumping)Ono (Effort noise while jumping)Ono (Effort noise while jumping)Ono (Effort noise while jumping)Ono (Ezio is hurt)Ono (Ezio is hurt)Ono (Ezio is hurt)Ono (Ezio is hurt)Ono (Ezio is hurt)Assassin!There he is!I've found him!Stop him!Stop the Assassin!",32175
